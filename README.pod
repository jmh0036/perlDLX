DLX - Dancing Links Algorithm for Exact Cover Problems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DLX;
  my $dlx = DLX->new();
  my $col_A = $dlx->add_column('A');
  my $col_B = $dlx->add_column('B');
  my $col_C = $dlx->add_column('C');
  my $col_D = $dlx->add_column('D');
  $dlx->add_row('row1', $col_A, $col_C);
  $dlx->add_row('row2', $col_B, $col_D);
  $dlx->add_row('row3', $col_A, $col_D);
  my $solutions = $dlx->solve();
